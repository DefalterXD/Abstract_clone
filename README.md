## Abstract_clone

It's just a simple project with a template website without a much functionality.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

I made this website with HTML and CSS using flexbox. <br>
This project was made fairly straight forward with the misalignment of my previous monitor aspect ration and standard [5:4 and 16:9]. <br>
Thus making all alignment of elements painfull process. But overall this is solid template for grasping styling with css and flex technology.

## Lesson Learned:

After that project I learned:
<ul>
<li>How to make a search bar</li>
<li>How to use flex technology for alignment</li>
<li>How to style overall according to template</li>
</ul>
